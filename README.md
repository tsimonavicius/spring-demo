# Development task

Create REST API to calculate factorial of provided number. 

In mathematics, the factorial of a positive integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. 
For example:  
`5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120`

Rules:  
`0! = 1
1! = 1
-n! = non existing`

Requirements:
* Use Spring infrastructure (Spring boot, Spring Framework, Spring Dataâ€¦)
* Design a REST API to calculate factorial of provided number
* Use Tests to prove your implementation

Extra:
* Use H2 DB to cache already counted values and use it to retrieve the result if exists

Feel free to use any tools and libs, which you think are necessary to implement the task. To speed up the start, use spring project template from https://github.com/MantasKavoliunas/spring-demo.git
